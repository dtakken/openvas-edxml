This is a transcoder that reads `OpenVAS <http://www.openvas.org/>`_ XML reports and produces `EDXML <http://edxml.org/>`_ containing OpenVAS scans, OpenVAS findings, detected applications, OpenVAS test listings, detected operating systems, discovered router listings, discovered SSL certificates, detected open port listings and OpenVAS test failures.

The transcoder enables automatic correlation of

- Openvas findings to computers (using OpenVAS findings)
- Certificates to organizations (using discovered SSL certificates)
- Certificates to computers (using discovered SSL certificates)

The transcoder enhances `concept mining <http://edxml.org/concept-mining>`_ by expanding knowledge about

:Openvas findings: Discovering new OpenVAS vulnerability severities, OpenVAS solution types, OpenVAS detection plugin IDs, OpenVAS impact descriptions, OpenVAS cross references, OpenVAS issue details, OpenVAS plugin names, OpenVAS QoD types, OpenVAS plugin families, OpenVAS threat levels, OpenVAS QoD values
:Vulnerabilities: Discovering new OpenVAS vulnerability severities, CVE numbers, CVSS base scores, BID numbers, CVSS base vectors
:Computers: Discovering new open ports, IPv4 addresses, CPE URIs, IPv6 addresses, host names
:Organizations: Discovering new country codes, organization names, cities, Distinguished Names, email addresses, regions, host names, unit names, wildcard host names, Common Names
:Certificates: Discovering new certificate fingerprints, valid from timestamps, valid until timestamps, host names

The transcoder identifies
- computers as vulnerability scanners
- OpenVAS findings as vulnerabilities (using OpenVAS findings)
- computers as network routers

The output can be auto-correlated with third party data sources that share any of the concepts and object types generated by this transcoder. These are listed below.
