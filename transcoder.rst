This is a transcoder that reads `OpenVAS <http://www.openvas.org/>`_ XML reports and produces `EDXML <http://edxml.org/>`_ containing OpenVAS findings, OpenVAS scans, OpenVAS test failures, OpenVAS test listings, detected applications, detected open port listings, detected operating systems, discovered SSL certificates and discovered router listings.

The transcoder enables automatic correlation of:

- Openvas scans to computers (using OpenVAS scans)
- Openvas findings to computers (using OpenVAS findings)
- Openvas findings to OpenVAS scans (using OpenVAS findings)
- Certificates to organizations (using discovered SSL certificates)
- Certificates to computers (using discovered SSL certificates)

The transcoder enhances `concept mining <http://edxml.org/concept-mining>`_ by expanding knowledge about:

:Openvas findings: Discovering new HTTP resource locators, OpenVAS detection plugin IDs, QoD types, QoD values, impact descriptions, issue details, plugin families, plugin names, solution types, threat levels and vulnerability severities
:Openvas scans: Discovering new OpenVAS scan IDs, finding counts, scan names and scanned host counts
:Certificates: Discovering new "valid from" timestamps, "valid until" timestamps, Common Names, DNS names, Distinguished Names, certificate fingerprints and wildcard host names
:Computers: Discovering new CPE URIs, DNS names, IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, TCP/IP network ports and open TCP/IP ports
:Organizations: Discovering new Common Names, DNS names, Distinguished Names, cities, country codes, e-mail addresses, organization names, regions and unit names
:Vulnerabilities: Discovering new BID numbers, CVE numbers, CVSS base scores, CVSS base vectors and vulnerability severities

The transcoder identifies:
- OpenVAS findings as vulnerabilities (using OpenVAS findings)
- computers as network routers
- computers as vulnerability scanners

The transcoder provides names for Distinguished Names and OIDs.

The transcoder identifies cities as being part of a region, plugin names as being part of a plugin family, regions as being part of a country code and unit names as being part of a organization name.

The output can be auto-correlated with third party data sources that share any of the concepts and object types generated by this transcoder. These are listed below.
